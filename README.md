## Pipeline_CodingProblem

* Pipeline_CodingProblem folder has single script Pipeline_CodingProblem.py which accepts ".csv" file as command line arguments. 

* It writes output to "ouput.json" file and and logs to my-logs.log file

## HPC_Prlbem

* HPC_Problem folder contains a Python script to calculate desired result.

* The script reads the number from "number.txt" file and writes the output to console.

* I used Python instead of C++ because I am most comfortable with Python.
